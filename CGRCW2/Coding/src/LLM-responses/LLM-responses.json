            "query" : "Nabil-Darwish: Can you explain to me, step by step how each step works. My vector mathematics understanding is pretty weak",
            "response" : "GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's break down the code:

            1. `double a = dotProduct(direction_perp, direction_perp);`
               This line calculates the square of the length of the direction vector perpendicular to the cylinder axis. This is part of the quadratic equation for the intersection of the ray with the infinite cylinder.
            
            2. `double b = 2.0 * dotProduct(oc_perp, direction_perp);`
               This line calculates the dot product of the vector from the cylinder center to the ray origin (oc_perp) and the direction vector perpendicular to the cylinder axis. This is also part of the quadratic equation for the intersection of the ray with the infinite cylinder.
            
            3. `double c = dotProduct(oc_perp, oc_perp) - cylinder_radius * cylinder_radius;`
               This line calculates the square of the length of the vector from the cylinder center to the ray origin (oc_perp), minus the square of the cylinder radius. This is the last part of the quadratic equation for the intersection of the ray with the infinite cylinder.
            
            4. `double discriminant = b*b - 4*a*c;`
               This line calculates the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant determines the number of solutions to the quadratic equation. If the discriminant is less than zero, the quadratic equation has no real solutions, which means the ray does not intersect the infinite cylinder.
            
            5. `if (discriminant < 0) { return false; }`
               This line checks if the discriminant is less than zero. If it is, the function returns false, indicating that the ray does not intersect the cylinder.
            
            6. `double t1 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a);`
               `double t2 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a);`
               These lines calculate the t values for the intersection points of the ray with the infinite cylinder. The t value represents the distance along the ray to the intersection point.
            
            7. `Vector3D p1 = r.at(t1);`
               `Vector3D p2 = r.at(t2);`
               These lines calculate the intersection points of the ray with the infinite cylinder.
            
            8. `double p1_proj_length = dotProduct(p1 - cylinder_center, cylinder_axis);`
               `double p2_proj_length = dotProduct(p2 - cylinder_center, cylinder_axis);`
               These lines calculate the distance of the intersection points from the cylinder center along the cylinder axis.
            
            9. `return (0 <= p1_proj_length && p1_proj_length <= cylinder_height) || (0 <= p2_proj_length && p2_proj_length <= cylinder_height);`
               This line checks if the intersection points are within the height of the cylinder. If at least one of the intersection points is within the height of the cylinder, the function returns true, indicating that the ray intersects the cylinder. Otherwise, it returns false.",

                            Color light_color = light->getIntensity();
            
                            // Shadow ray check. Origin is the intersection point, direction is the light direction
                            Ray shadow_ray(record.p, light_direction);
                            Hit_record temp_rec;
                            // Check if shadow ray intersects any of the shapes in the scene

                                // Check if the ray from point to light source is obstructed by any other shape, including itself
                                if (shape->is_light_source_obstructed(shadow_ray, Interval(0.001, distance_to_light), light->getPosition())) {

            How would I adapt it here? is_light_source_obstructed is a function defined within shape and for a sphere, I defined it to be the opposite of the hit function",
            "response" : "GitHub Copilot: You can adapt your code by moving the lighting calculation logic to the `Scene` class. You can create a method in `Scene` that takes a `Hit_record` object, a `Ray` object, and a `Shape` object as parameters, and calculates the lighting for the hit point on the shape.

            Here's an example:
            
            ```cpp
            class Scene {
                // ... other code ...
            
                Color calculateLightingForHitPoint(const Ray& ray, const Hit_record& record, const Shape& shape) const {
                    Color total_light(0, 0, 0);
            
                    for (const auto& light : lights) {
                        Vector3D light_direction = light->getPosition() - record.p;
                        double distance_to_light = getLength(light_direction);
                        light_direction = normalize(light_direction);
                        Color light_color = light->getIntensity();
            
                        Ray shadow_ray(record.p, light_direction);
                        bool is_shadowed = false;
            
                        for (const auto& other_shape : shapes) {
                            if (other_shape->is_light_source_obstructed(shadow_ray, Interval(0.001, distance_to_light), light->getPosition())) {
                                is_shadowed = true;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
            
                        if (!is_shadowed) {
                            Vector3D view_direction = -ray.getDirection();
                            total_light += record.mat_ptr->shade(record, light_direction, view_direction, light_color, distance_to_light);
                        }
                    }
            
                    return total_light;
                }
            };
            ```
            
            Then, in the part of your code where you detect a hit on a shape, you can call this method to calculate the lighting for the hit point:
            
            ```cpp
            if (shape->hit(ray, t_values, rec)) {
                Color light = scene->calculateLightingForHitPoint(ray, rec, *shape);
                // ... use light ...
            }
            ```
            
            This approach allows you to calculate the lighting for a specific hit point on a specific shape, without introducing a circular dependency between `Shape` and `Scene`." ,
